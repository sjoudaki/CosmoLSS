# CosmoLSS

We release modified CosmoMC modules and associated data files to perform a combined analysis of cosmic shear tomography, galaxy-galaxy lensing tomography, and redshift-space multipole power spectra (monopole and quadrupole) using 450 sq deg of imaging data by the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-450) overlapping with two spectroscopic surveys: the 2-degree Field Lensing Survey (2dFLenS) and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We include the full covariance between the observables, scales, and samples using a large suite of N-body simulations.

The fitting pipeline includes key astrophysical systematics arising from intrinsic galaxy alignments, baryonic effects in the nonlinear matter power spectrum, photometric redshift uncertainties, galaxy bias, pairwise velocity dispersion, and shot noise (the latter three for each galaxy sample). The modified modules and associated data are contained in a clean version of CosmoMC (July 2015 version) in "cosmolss.tar.gz".

There is more specific information in the readme file included in the tarball.
