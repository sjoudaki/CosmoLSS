# CosmoLSS

We include modified CosmoMC modules and associated data files to perform a combined analysis of cosmic shear tomography, galaxy-galaxy lensing tomography, and redshift-space multipole power spectra (monopole and quadrupole) using 450 sq deg of imaging data by the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-450) overlapping with two spectroscopic surveys: the 2-degree Field Lensing Survey (2dFLenS) and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). 

The modified modules and associated data are contained in a clean version of CosmoMC (July 2015 version) in "cosmomclss.tar.gz".

Please feel free to contact us at shahab.joudaki@physics.ox.ac.uk if you have any questions.
